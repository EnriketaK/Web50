                The Galilean moons (or Galilean satellites) are the four largest moons of Jupiter. They were first seen by Galileo Galilei in  1609  and recognized by him as satellites of Jupiter in  1610. They were the first objects found to orbit a planet other than the Earth. 
            </p>

            <p class="main-txt">
                They are among the largest objects in the Solar System with the exception of the Sun and the eight planets. The three inner moons—Io, Europa, and Ganymede—are in a 4:2:1 orbital resonance with each other. Because of their much smaller size, and therefore weaker self-gravitation, all of Jupiter's remaining moons have irregular forms rather than a spherical shape.
            </p>

            <p class="main-txt">
                The Galilean moons were observed  when Galileo made improvements to his telescope, which enabled him to observe celestial bodies more distinctly than ever. Galileo's observations showed the importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by proving that there were objects in space that cannot be seen by the naked eye. 
                The discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a serious blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system, a geocentric theory in which everything orbits around Earth.
            </p>

            <p class="main-txt">
                Galileo initially named his discovery the Cosmica Sidera ("Cosimo's stars"). However, Simon Marius – a German astronomer who also claimed to have found these four moons – prescribed the names Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto (after Zeus’ lovers in the Greek mythology) in 1614.
                While these names fell out of favor for many centuries, they became commonplace by the 20th century. Together, they also became known as the Galileans, in honor of their discoverer.

              <p>
                Some models predict that there may have been several generations of Galilean satellites in Jupiter's early history. 
                Each generation of moons to have formed would have spiraled into Jupiter and been destroyed, due to tidal interactions with Jupiter's proto-satellite disk, with new moons forming from the remaining debris. 
                By the time the present generation formed, the gas in the proto-satellite disk had thinned out to the point that it no longer greatly interfered with the moons' orbits. 
              </p>

              <h2>Visibility</h2>
              <p>
                All four Galilean moons are bright enough to be viewed from Earth without a telescope, if only they could appear farther away from Jupiter. 
                (They are, however, easily distinguished with even low-powered binoculars.) They have apparent magnitudes between 4.6 and 5.6 when Jupiter is in opposition with the Sun, and are about one unit of magnitude dimmer when Jupiter is in conjunction. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The main difficulty in observing the moons from Earth is their proximity to Jupiter, since they are obscured by its brightness. The maximum angular separations of the moons are between 2 and 
                10 arcminutes from Jupiter, which is close to the limit of human visual acuity. Ganymede and Callisto, at their maximum separation, are the likeliest targets for potential naked-eye observation.
