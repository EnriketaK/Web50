        <h1>The Galilean Moons</h1>
        <p>Jupiter has 53 named moons. Others are awaiting official names. Combined, scientists now think Jupiter has 79 moons. </p>
        <p>There are many interesting moons orbiting the planet, but the ones of most scientific interest are the first four moons discovered beyond Earth—the Galilean satellites:</p>

                The Galilean moons (or Galilean satellites) are the four largest moons of Jupiter. They were first seen by Galileo Galilei in  1609  and recognized by him as satellites of Jupiter in  1610. They were the first objects found to orbit a planet other than the Earth.

                They are among the largest objects in the Solar System with the exception of the Sun and the eight planets. The three inner moons—Io, Europa, and Ganymede—are in a 4:2:1 orbital resonance with each other. Because of their much smaller size, and therefore weaker self-gravitation, all of Jupiter's remaining moons have irregular forms rather than a spherical shape.

                The Galilean moons were observed  when Galileo made improvements to his telescope, which enabled him to observe celestial bodies more distinctly than ever. Galileo's observations showed the importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by proving that there were objects in space that cannot be seen by the naked eye. 
                The discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a serious blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system, a geocentric theory in which everything orbits around Earth.

            <p class="main-txt">
                Galileo initially named his discovery the Cosmica Sidera ("Cosimo's stars"). However, Simon Marius – a German astronomer who also claimed to have found these four moons – prescribed the names Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto (after Zeus’ lovers in the Greek mythology) in 1614.
                While these names fell out of favor for many centuries, they became commonplace by the 20th century. Together, they also became known as the Galileans, in honor of their discoverer.
