                Io or Jupiter I, is the innermost and third-largest of the four Galilean moons of the planet Jupiter. It is the fourth-largest moon in the solar system, has the highest density of all of them, 
                and has the lowest amount of water of any known astronomical object in the Solar System. It was was named after the mythological character Io, a priestess of Hera who became one of Zeus's lovers.
            </p>

            <p class="main-txt">
                It has over 400 active volcanoes. Io's surface is also dotted with more than 100 mountains that have been uplifted by extensive compression at the base of Io's silicate crust. Some of these peaks are taller than Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth's surface.

            <p class="main-txt">
                Io's volcanism is responsible for many of its unique features. Its volcanic plumes and lava flows produce large surface changes and paint the surface in various subtle shades of yellow, red, white, black, and green.

            <p class="main-txt">
                Io played a significant role in the development of astronomy in the 17th and 18th centuries. It was discovered in January 1610 by Galileo Galilei, along with the other Galilean satellites. 
                This discovery furthered the adoption of the Copernican model of the Solar System, the development of Kepler's laws of motion, and the first measurement of the speed of light. In 1979, 
                the two Voyager spacecraft revealed Io to be a geologically active world, with numerous volcanic features, large mountains, and a young surface with no obvious impact craters.

        <p class="list-header">5 Need-to-Know Things About Io:</p>
        
        <ol class="list-items">
            <li>SMALL, NOT TINY: Io is only slightly larger than Earth’s moon and about one-quarter the diameter of Earth itself.</li>
            <li>OUT THERE: Io orbits the planet Jupiter, which itself orbits the Sun at a distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers).</li>
            <li>GRAVITATIONALLY TAMED: Tidal Lock: Over 1.8 Earth days, Io rotates once on its axis and completes one orbit of Jupiter, causing the same side of Io to always face Jupiter.</li>
            <li>ERUPTIVE:The moon Io is the most volcanically active world in the solar system. Io even has lakes of molten silicate lava on its surface.</li>
            <li>INGREDIENTS FOR LIFE? Io almost certainly could not support life as we know it. But that’s not to say it couldn’t harbor some form of life as we don’t know it.</li>
